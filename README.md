Write a parser that can read and evaluate numerical statements (only with constant numbers, not variables). It should be able to handle all of the following:

	- Addition/subtraction
	- Multiplication/division
	- Exponents
	- Parentheses

The parser should read and evaluate strings, using standard order of operations (PEMDAS). Create whatever classes and functions are necessary to support arbitrarily complex mathematical statements. You will be provided with an interface for the main parser class and a set of unit tests that must pass for your answer to be considered complete.
